# trustworthiness-assessment-skill

A [Claude skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) for conducting **forensic trustworthiness assessments** of research articles and clinical trials — judging whether reported results and conclusions can be *believed* (possibility, plausibility, claim–evidence alignment), which is narrower than general peer review.

```

`SKILL.md` is intentionally lean: it drives the workflow and points to the references, which load on demand. The method itself lives in `references/forensic-method.md`.



## Where this skill runs (read first)

This skill's engine is **R + Quarto + your local files** (PDFs) + the local [`recalc`](https://github.com/ianhussey/recalc) package. So it must run on a
surface that has a local toolchain and local file access — i.e. **Claude Code on your own machine** (the terminal CLI, the Claude Code desktop app, or the VS Code / JetBrains extensions).

It will **not** run in the consumer **Claude Desktop app** (the claude.ai-login app) or in **Claude Cowork**: those run code in a Python-focused sandbox with no
R, no Quarto, and no access to your local files or local packages — so the quantitative checks (GRIM, `recalc`, `quarto render`) cannot execute there even
if the skill text loads. You can *add* and *invoke* the skill in those surfaces, but the analysis will not run. Use Claude Code on your own machine for this skill.



## Install

### A. Local skills folder (works everywhere Claude Code runs — recommended)

A skill is just a folder with `SKILL.md` at its root. Drop this repo into a Claude Code skills directory and it is auto-discovered:

```sh
# personal (all projects):
git clone https://github.com/ianhussey/trustworthiness-assessment-skill \
  ~/.claude/skills/trustworthiness-assessment
# or symlink an existing local clone instead of re-cloning:
ln -sfn /path/to/trustworthiness-assessment-skill \
  ~/.claude/skills/trustworthiness-assessment
# or per project:
git clone https://github.com/ianhussey/trustworthiness-assessment-skill \
  /path/to/project/.claude/skills/trustworthiness-assessment
```

Update with `git -C <that dir> pull`. The folder name need not match the `name:` in `SKILL.md`, but a clean name is tidier. **Note:** if `~/.claude/skills/` did not exist when your session started, **restart Claude Code** so it begins watching the new directory (an existing skills dir picks up additions live).

### B. Plugin marketplace — **terminal CLI / IDE only**

The `/plugin` marketplace flow is supported **only in the Claude Code terminal CLI and the IDE extensions** — it is *not* available in the Claude Code desktop app or the consumer Claude Desktop app. Where it is available, this repo ships the manifests (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugin.json`) so you can run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add ianhussey/trustworthiness-assessment-skill
/plugin install trustworthiness-assessment@ianhussey-skills
```

Update later with `/plugin marketplace update ianhussey-skills`. If `/plugin` reports it "isn't available in this environment", use route **A** instead — it
works on every Claude Code surface. Installing by either route only *fetches* the repo; no code runs until you invoke the skill (see [Security](#scope--security)).



## Dependencies (one-time local setup)

Install **R** and **Quarto** on your machine, then the R packages — `scrutiny`, `statcheck`, `metafor`, `tidyverse`, `kableExtra` (all CRAN) and
[`recalc`](https://github.com/ianhussey/recalc) **(≥ 0.6)** — Ian Hussey's package, which provides the baseline-p, partial-η², and pre–post-r recalculation checks:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "metafor", "scrutiny", "statcheck", "kableExtra", "remotes"))
remotes::install_github("ianhussey/recalc")   # needs >= 0.6
```

If `recalc` is absent, skip the recalc-based steps (baseline-p, partial-η², pre–post-r) and note it. See `references/r-cookbook.md` for the per-package API notes (including the scrutiny ≥0.6 `digits_x` change).



## Using the skill in Claude

Once installed the skill is **auto-discovered** at session start — no enable step. In every surface there are two ways to use it:

- **Invoke directly** from the `/` menu — type `/` and pick `trustworthiness-assessment` (if installed as a plugin it may be namespaced,
  e.g. `trustworthiness-assessment:trustworthiness-assessment`; run `/help` to see the exact name). Then point it at the paper, e.g. *"assess the PDF in `pdfs/`; the registration is the CSV beside it."*
- **Let Claude trigger it** by describing the task — e.g. *"do a trustworthiness assessment of this trial"*, *"can these reported numbers be trusted?"*,
  *"GRIM-check this baseline table"*, *"recalculate the baseline p-values"*. The `description in `SKILL.md` is written to fire on these.

Give Claude the article (PDF/text) and, for a trial, the registration record; it then works the Step 0–5 workflow and produces the classified verdict.



## Scope & security

**Security.** Installing this skill by either route only *fetches* files — no code runs at install time. `scripts/helpers.R` executes only when you invoke the
skill and Claude runs the analysis, the same trust boundary as any code you clone and run. Review before use.

**Scope.** This skill produces a *starting point*, not a verdict to act on unchecked. Its findings describe what does and does not cohere in the reported
numbers; they do not impute intent. Re-verify the arithmetic against the article and have a statistician review impossibility claims before treating any finding as established or contacting a journal or author.
